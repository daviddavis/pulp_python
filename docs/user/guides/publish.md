# Publish and Host Your Python Content

This section assumes that you have a repository with content in it. To do this, see the
[sync](site:pulp_python/docs/user/guides/sync/) or [upload](site:pulp_python/docs/user/guides/upload/) documentation.

## Create a Publication (manually)

Kick off a publish task by creating a new publication. The publish task will generate all the
metadata that `pip` needs to install packages (although it will need to be hosted through a
Distribution before it is consumable).

=== "Run"

    ```bash
    # Create a new publication specifying the repository_version.
    # Alternatively, you can specify just the repository, and Pulp will assume the latest version.
    pulp python publication create --repository foo --version 1
    
    # Publications can only be referenced through their pulp_href
    PUBLICATION_HREF=$(pulp python publication list | jq -r .[0].pulp_href)
    ```

=== "Output"

    ```
    {
      "pulp_href": "/pulp/api/v3/publications/python/pypi/cad6007d-7172-41d1-8c22-0ec95e1d242a/",
      "pulp_created": "2021-03-09T04:30:16.686784Z",
      "repository_version": "/pulp/api/v3/repositories/python/python/8fbb24ee-dc91-44f4-a6ee-beec60aa542d/versions/1/",
      "repository": "/pulp/api/v3/repositories/python/python/8fbb24ee-dc91-44f4-a6ee-beec60aa542d/",
      "distributions": []
    }
    ```

## Host a Publication (Create a Distribution)

To host a publication, (which makes it consumable by `pip`), users create a distribution which
will serve the associated publication at `/pypi/<distribution.base_path>/`

=== "Run"

    ```bash
    # Distributions are created asynchronously. Create one, and specify the publication that will
    # be served at the base path specified.
    pulp python distribution create --name foo --base-path foo --publication "$PUBLICATION_HREF"
    ```

=== "Output"

    ```
    {
       "pulp_href": "/pulp/api/v3/distributions/python/pypi/4839c056-6f2b-46b9-ac5f-88eb8a7739a5/",
       "pulp_created": "2021-03-09T04:36:48.289737Z",
       "base_path": "foo",
       "base_url": "/pypi/foo/",
       "content_guard": null,
       "pulp_labels": {},
       "name": "foo",
       "publication": "/pulp/api/v3/publications/python/pypi/a09111b1-6bce-43ac-aed7-2e8441c22704/"
     }
    ```

## Automate Publication and Distribution

With a little more initial setup, you can have publications and distributions for your repositories
updated automatically when new repository versions are created.

```bash
# This configures the repository to produce new publications when a new version is created
pulp python repository update --name foo --autopublish
# This configures the distribution to be track the latest repository version for a given repository
pulp python distribution update --name foo --repository foo
```

!!! warning
    Support for automatic publication and distribution is provided as a tech preview in Pulp 3.
    Functionality may not work or may be incomplete. Also, backwards compatibility when upgrading
    is not guaranteed.

## Enable Pull-Through Caching:

Only packages present in your repository will be available from your index, but adding a remote source to
your distribution will enable the pull-through cache feature. This feature allows you to install any package
from the remote source and have Pulp store that package as orphaned content.

```bash
# Add remote to distribution to enable pull-through caching
pulp python distribution update --name foo --remote bar
```

!!! note
    Pull-through caching will respect the includes/excludes filters on the supplied remote.

!!! warning
    Support for pull-through caching is provided as a tech preview in Pulp 3.
    Functionality may not work or may be incomplete. Also, backwards compatibility when upgrading
    is not guaranteed.

## Use the newly created distribution

The metadata and packages can now be retrieved from the distribution:

```bash
$ http $BASE_ADDR/pypi/foo/simple/
$ http $BASE_ADDR/pypi/foo/simple/shelf-reader/
```

!!! note
    When domains are enabled, it is necessary to include the domain name within the URL, like so:
    `$BASE_ADDR/pypi/${DOMAIN_NAME}/foo/simple/`

The content is also pip installable:

```bash
$ pip install --trusted-host localhost -i $BASE_ADDR/pypi/foo/simple/ shelf-reader
```

If you don't want to specify the distribution path every time, you can modify your `pip.conf`
file. See the [pip docs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#configuration) for more
detail.:

=== "Run"

    ```bash
    $ cat pip.conf
    ```

=== "Output"

    ```
    [global]
    index-url = http://localhost:24817/pypi/foo/simple/
    ```

The above configuration informs `pip` to install from `pulp`:

```bash
$ pip install --trusted-host localhost shelf-reader
```
